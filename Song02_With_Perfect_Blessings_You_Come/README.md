# With Perfect Blessings, You Come - உத்தம ஆசீர்வாதங்களோடு நீர் வருகிறீர்

This royal song of triumph echoes Psalm 21 — the king rejoices in God’s strength, crowned with pure gold, granted life forevermore, enemies destroyed. It proclaims Jesus Christ as the ultimate King — crowned with many crowns (Rev 19:12), granting eternal life to His own, judging every foe with righteous fire. In the eternal day, this victory is complete — we reign with Him, crowned in His glory forever (Rev 22:5).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, crowned King with many crowns,
thank You for perfect blessings, golden crown, eternal life.
Crush every enemy, grant us Your victory.
In the eternal day, let us reign with You forever.
Come quickly, our triumphant King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
